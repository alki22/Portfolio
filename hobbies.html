							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<q>Outside (and not so much) of my professional activity, you can find me reading about:</q>
							<ul class="ul2">
								<li>The collective unconscious and more specific studies on more specific expressions of it. For example, I like to read about Levi-Strauss' structural anthropology, Jung's archetypes and symbols, among others. In particular, I would be interested in establishing a link between these studies and LLMs.</li>
								<li>History (as a hobby) from a classical, cultural perspective and, to some extent, from a historical materialism perspective. I am particularly interested in the classical periods of Europe, the early and late Middle Ages in Europe, Africa and Asia, and the Cold War in Latin America. It is a cliché, but I am interested in looking at what has already happened to see how we are going wrong now and not repeating it in the future by using it in the analysis of current events.</li>
								<li>Superficially (I haven't done much academic reading yet), I am interested in the analysis of micro and macroeconomic structures. Almost always hand in hand with history. I am interested in seeing the advance (or not) of so-called techno-feudalism in production relations in the coming years.</li>
							</ul>
							<q>Ultimately, I would like to take elements from all these domains in order to, in some way, improve people's lives through the construction of bonds, support for community life projects, sport, narrative construction, etc.</q>
							<q>On a more mundane note, my hobbies include:</q>
							<ul class="ul2">
								<li>Playing video games. I am a fan of various genres such as RPG, Grand Strategy, and Tactics. My favourite series are Persona, Pokémon, and Europa Universalis, but from time to time you might see me playing Fortnite or GTA, haha. I want to create a great video game; it's one of my big dreams.</li>
								<li>Playing the piano, although I'm just starting out with some songs from my teenage years and videogame OSTs.</li>
								<li>Cultural exchanges to establish patterns or parallels, trying good food and learning expressions and words from different languages. I speak Spanish, English, French, Italian and Greek.</li>
								<li>Travelling. My goal in terms of travel is to visit all the countries and various locations of the former Roman Empire. This trip led me to discover the most important examples of Roman and Byzantine mosaic art. I would like to get started in this field at some point.</li>
							</ul>
